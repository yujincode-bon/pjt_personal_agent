Evidence suggests supplemental L-glutamine benefits gastrointestinal health, supports wound healing, maintains immune health, and helps restore plasma glutamine levels depleted after periods of physical stress, such as prolonged exhaustive exercise. L-glutamine is the most prevalent amino acid in the bloodstream. It is found in high concentration in the gastrointestinal tract, which is its greatest user. Various stress factors – such as trauma, infection, malnutrition, chemotherapy, injury, and high-level athletic training – can adversely affect absorption in the small intestine, leading to food allergies. In numerous animal studies, the addition of L-glutamine improved absorption, as well as the gut's immune function.Skeletal muscles contain the greatest intracellular concentration of L-glutamine. But that concentration can be adversely affected by various insults, including injury, infection, chronic stress, malnutrition, and glucocorticoid use. Intense exercise lowers blood levels of glutamine, which can remain low if intense training is repeated without adequate recovery. Research indicates L-glutamine supplementation can offset these conditions.Because an athlete needs to know that his or her supplements are trustworthy and compliant, every batch of an NSF Certified for Sport® product is tested for compliance with label claims and to ensure the absence of more than 200 substances banned by many major athletic organizations, including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, and masking agents.",성분 추출 실패

Tyrosine also promotes healthy adrenal function.Two thyroid hormones – thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) – regulate the body's metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, directing how the body uses these compounds to produce energy. Thyroxine supports cardiac output, heart rate, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate. The thyroid gland cannot produce these two hormones without the presence of the amino acid L-tyrosine and the mineral iodine. Thus, a deficiency of either the amino acid or the mineral or both can contribute to low thyroid hormone levels. Thorne's Iodine & Tyrosine offers essential mineral and amino acid support for the thyroid gland. Studies have found L-tyrosine can be beneficial for treating fatigue, a common symptom of low thyroid or adrenal hormone levels.Tyrosine is also an important cofactor for adrenal neurotransmitter synthesis, because it is converted in the adrenal glands into dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.Individuals should be aware that some foods can cause a relative iodine deficiency by binding to iodine, which can make the bound iodine inaccessible for thyroid hormone production. These foods include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, soy, peanuts, pine nuts, turnips, and rutabaga, although cooking these foods tends to make them less apt to do this.",성분 추출 실패
