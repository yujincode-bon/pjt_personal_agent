    "description": "Dietary SupplementEnviroSimplex® Processed Plant ExtractsThe Most Metabolically Active FormSuitable for Vegetarians/VegansPurity & Potency GuaranteedWhat does coenzymated mean?In order for B vitamins to be utilized effectively by the body, they must be converted into their metabolically active coenzyme forms. For example, two coenzyme forms of vitamin B12 are methylcobalamin and dibencozide.A coenzyme is a naturally occurring compound that partners with specific enzymes in order to help promote a number of beneficial metabolic reactions in the body. Without the coenzyme, the enzyme cannot promote the biochemical reaction that is responsible for our survival. This dual cooperation between coenzyme and enzyme is a process called coenzymated.Taking B vitamins already in their coenzymated forms allows the body to use them directly. Thus, the amount that is needed by the body is less in order to achieve the same benefits. Biocoenzymated takes it one step further. Using our proprietary EnviroSimplex® technology, we've created a unique biocoenzymated process using organic, farm fresh plant extracts from whole food sources and the coenzyme form of B vitamins. The synergy between the phytochemicals found in these plant extracts and the coenzyme B vitamin optimizes absorption.The results? Biocoenzymated delivers the most metabolically active nutrients to your cells to utilize most effectively.Feel the difference.Vitamin B12 helps produce red blood cells, maintain good health, and prevent B12 deficiency states such as pernicious anemia. Methylcobalamin and dibencozide are coenzyme forms of vitamin B12 whereas cyanocobalamin must be converted to its metabolically active coenzyme form in a two-step process. Taking methylcobalamin and/or dibencozide allows for greater absorption and bioavailability than non-coenzyme forms. Natural Factors BioCoenzymated Methylcobalamin & Dibencozide formula is offered in a convenient one-per-day chewable form.Isura™: Non-GMO: Documentation ✔Mass Spec: Lab Tested ✔",

Not The Fish.® A New Generation In Superior Plant-Based OmegasAhiflower® oil is the richest and most effective combined Omega-3 (SDA and ALA) and Omega-6 (GLA and LA) fatty acid source from a single non-GMO plant found in nature. While there are many sources of plant based Omega-3 ALA such as flax, chia, sacha inchi and hemp seed oils, Ahiflower® oil is the richest source of SDA (stearidonic acid) which converts more efficiently to the Omega 3 fatty acid EPA that is found in fish oil. A human clinical trial found that Ahiflower® oil has up to a 3-4 times greater conversion rate to Omega 3 EPA compared to flax seed oil. Ahiflower® oil also contains beneficial Omega 6 gamma linolenic acid (GLA). A true Omega 3 and Omega 6 powerhouse with ALA, SDA and GLA, delivering a healthy 4 to 1 balance of Omega 3 to Omega 6, Ahiflower® oil is the most eco-conscious, sustainable way to get the benefits of EPA found in fish oil from a vegan, plant-based source. ",

Zinc also promotes immune function, taste sensitivity, protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, healthy insulin response and more. Age-related declines in immune function are associated with zinc deficiency. Certain aspects of immune function in the elderly have been found to be supported with zinc supplementation.Chromium plays an important role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels in those within normal range when used as part of a healthy diet.Boron is an essential nutrient for supporting optimal calcium metabolism as well as healthy bones and joints. Boron intake may also support a healthy prostate. It's been shown to help inhibit oxidative stress and support the body’s normal use of reproductive hormones and vitamin D.Vanadyl sulfate is an effective form of the trace mineral vanadium. Research indicates vanadyl sulfate may support insulin response and help maintain already-healthy glucose metabolism. Research also indicates vanadium salts may help maintain already-healthy blood pressure, thyroid health and iron metabolism.Copper is required by the body to convert iron into a form that can be utilized by hemoglobin, and is an essential constituent of many important enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, a major cellular antioxidant. It’s also needed for normal immune function and synthesis of certain proteins. People who consume over 50 mg of zinc daily and/or a high level of fructose are advised to supplement their diet with 2 mg copper several times per week.",

Not only does Alpha EAA include a full-spectrum EAA matrix featuring 8.2 g of EAA’s and 6 g of fermented BCAA’s but we added a focus and hydration complex as well. It’s this focus matrix that really puts this product over the top and differentiates it from any amino based supplement available. Our focus matrix is comprised of a combination of the world’s most popular adaptogen, Ashwagandha KSM-66 and three of the most effective nootropics around, Alpha-GPC, VitaCholine and Huperzine A. To round out this novel formula and enhance it even more, we included taurine and CocoPure to support hydration and AstraGin to increase amino uptake and absorption.Alpha EAA is designed to promote all day focus, recovery and hydration. Alpha EAA supports improved brain function, mental acuity and memory, balances cortisol levels, enhances power output and muscular contractions. So if you’re looking for a non-stimulant source of energy, superior hydration and recovery Alpha EAA is the perfect addition to everyone’s supplement regimen.",

Enriched with California's almonds, dates, and figs, a cup of Teeccino brims with many health benefits:100% naturally caffeine free—better than decafAcid Free—helps restore alkaline balanceNatural energy boost—from nutrients, not stimulantsHeart-healthy potassium—for optimal performancePrebiotic - Inulin, a soluble fiber in chicory root, supports gut health to improve digestion, elimination and the immune systemBeyond Fair Trade: Creating New Trade!Most of Teeccino's ingredients are grown in Europe and the USA. We pioneer new trade for organic chicory with smallholder farmers in India and for wild harvested ramón seeds with rainforest villagers in Central America.

    "description": "Gluten FreeDietary SupplementFoundationalWomen's HealthNSF Certified SportOptimal balance of B vitamins with extra B6 for brain and nerve health and PMS discomfort.B-Complex #6 includes essential B vitamins. Its extra B6 is important for neurotransmitter synthesis, which is essential for stress and mood support. It can also help modulate fluid retention.B-Complex #6 is NSF Certified for Sport®. Most B vitamins, with the exception of vitamin B12, are not stored in the body; consequently, they must be acquired daily from the diet in order to maintain optimal health. Thorne's B-Complex #6 contains an optimal balance of essential B vitamins with extra vitamin B6. B-Complex #6 contains thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin and riboflavin 5'-phosphate (vitamin B2), niacinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine and pyridoxal 5'-phospate (vitamin B6), methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), methyl-folate (5-MTHF), and biotin. Although each B vitamin is chemically distinct, they often work together in various biochemical functions throughout the body – from cellular energy production, to healthy red-blood-cell formation, to healthy neurological function. B-Complex #6 offer both pyridoxine and active pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to support brain function through neurotransmitter synthesis and neurological function through the formation of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. B6 can also help relieve the symptom of fluid retention and support a good mood in individuals with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).Supplementing with active B vitamins is important for everyone, and especially for individuals whose livers may not be able to convert the non-active B vitamin forms to their active forms because of compromised liver function, poorly functioning enzymes, digestive disturbances, or age.Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and its bioactive form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (P5P), are essential for such processes as amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and glycogen (storage sugar) breakdown. Pyridoxine and P5P are also involved in heme synthesis (necessary for hemoglobin), conversion of tryptophan to niacin, and the proper metabolism of fatty acids. Thorne's B-Complex #6 supplies 106 mg of pyridoxine HCl, 25 mg pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and the bioactive forms of other B vitamins in each capsule to provide an optimally bioavailable B complex.Because an athlete needs to know that his or her supplements are trustworthy and compliant, every batch of an NSF Certified for Sport® product is tested for compliance with label claims and to ensure the absence of more than 200 substances banned by many major athletic organizations, including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, and masking agents.",

Our algae DHA gives you a brain boost and supports healthy nerves and vision, so you can get the most out of life. iwi Omega-3 also includes special Omega-7 fatty acids for additional heart health support and chlorophyll as a natural antioxidant.LESS IS MORE: iwi's Almega® PL is clinically proven to help your body absorb 50% more Omega 3 than fish, krill, and other algae oils, and therefore requires less dosage; each serving contains a high concentration of 150 MG of EPA, 100 MG of DHA, and a high potency of other Omega-3s. iwi algae is sustainably farmed and made in the USA, cultivated in the New Mexico & Texas desert with saltwater and powered by the sun. Our iwi algae produce 300x the amino acids and essential nutrients per acre, compared to traditionally farmed crops such as peas. As we grow, we believe our farming revolution will not only feed the planet but help preserve it, too. Our eco friendly paper pack helps reduce single-use plastic waste to protect the Earth we love! Did you know that neither fish nor krill actually produce Omega-3s? They obtain them by consuming nutrient-rich algae. So skip the middle fish and get your Omega-3s straight from the source, nature's richest supply, algae. We do not remove fish or krill from the eco-system to produce it.",
