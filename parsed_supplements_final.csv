Glycine is the smallest and simplest amino acid, making it versatile for use in a wide range of functions. Glycine is necessary for the production of glutathione, DNA, creatine, bile, hemoglobin, and most proteins. It also helps to promote glycogen storage, thereby making glucose readily available for energy production. Glycine also functions as a calming neurotransmitter in the brain, where it facilitates nerve impulses and is important for the maintenance of healthy sleep patterns.","None.

Encouraging healthy T-cell development, our formula also helps maintain a healthy immune response and promotes longevity.Take steps today to support longevity and youthful immune function by supplementing with Standardized Cistanche.Standardized Cistanche BenefitsHelps maintain healthy immune functionSupports blood pressure already within normal rangeEncourages healthy glucose metabolismPromotes longevityStandardized Cistanche That Isn't So StandardPrimarily known for supporting longevity, our formula utilizes the plant extracts found in Cistanche to support more than just healthy aging factors. As a means of supporting an already-healthy inflammatory response and blood pressure, the echinacosides in this plant extract encourage healthy nervous system function for optimal immune senescence protection.Standardized Cistanche provides powerful support against immune senescence. Researchers have found evidence that Cistanche extracts help support healthy glucose metabolism, promote a healthy inflammatory response and maintain already-healthy blood pressure and lipid levels.Scientists have discovered that the echinacoside compound found in Cistanche plant extract stimulates the development of naive T cells and leads to a lower amount of memory T cells, thereby supporting a healthy immune response. Cistanche polysaccharides have also demonstrated positive modulatory effects on T cells and may support vaccine responsiveness. Cistanche also increased natural killer (NK) cell activity, resulting in a 15% life span increase in animal research. In addition, Cistanche and echinacoside have been found to scavenge free radicals, maintain healthy nervous system function and promote longevity.A 12-week human study of a dietary supplement containing standardized Cistanche showed that it encouraged impressive immune factor support after supplementation. Subjects had a 11.7% increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity and a 20.2% increase in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells.

Switch to Imperial units","Dietary SupplementEnviroSimplex® Processed Plant ExtractsThe Most Metabolically Active FormSuitable for Vegetarians/VegansPurity & Potency GuaranteedWhat does coenzymated mean?In order for B vitamins to be utilized effectively by the body, they must be converted into their metabolically active coenzyme forms. For example, two coenzyme forms of vitamin B12 are methylcobalamin and dibencozide.A coenzyme is a naturally occurring compound that partners with specific enzymes in order to help promote a number of beneficial metabolic reactions in the body. Without the coenzyme, the enzyme cannot promote the biochemical reaction that is responsible for our survival. This dual cooperation between coenzyme and enzyme is a process called coenzymated.Taking B vitamins already in their coenzymated forms allows the body to use them directly. Thus, the amount that is needed by the body is less in order to achieve the same benefits. Biocoenzymated takes it one step further. Using our proprietary EnviroSimplex® technology, we've created a unique biocoenzymated process using organic, farm fresh plant extracts from whole food sources and the coenzyme form of B vitamins. The synergy between the phytochemicals found in these plant extracts and the coenzyme B vitamin optimizes absorption.The results? Biocoenzymated delivers the most metabolically active nutrients to your cells to utilize most effectively.Feel the difference.Vitamin B12 helps produce red blood cells, maintain good health, and prevent B12 deficiency states such as pernicious anemia. Methylcobalamin and dibencozide are coenzyme forms of vitamin B12 whereas cyanocobalamin must be converted to its metabolically active coenzyme form in a two-step process. Taking methylcobalamin and/or dibencozide allows for greater absorption and bioavailability than non-coenzyme forms.

It’s also no secret that these drinks come with a few side effects — they can leave you feeling jittery, stressed and over-stimulated. Not to mention the extra sugar associated with many drinks. Enter L-theanine, caffeine’s natural soul mate.

Not The Fish.® A New Generation In Superior Plant-Based OmegasAhiflower® oil is the richest and most effective combined Omega-3 (SDA and ALA) and Omega-6 (GLA and LA) fatty acid source from a single non-GMO plant found in nature. While there are many sources of plant based Omega-3 ALA such as flax, chia, sacha inchi and hemp seed oils, Ahiflower® oil is the richest source of SDA (stearidonic acid) which converts more efficiently to the Omega 3 fatty acid EPA that is found in fish oil. A human clinical trial found that Ahiflower® oil has up to a 3-4 times greater conversion rate to Omega 3 EPA compared to flax seed oil. Ahiflower® oil also contains beneficial Omega 6 gamma linolenic acid (GLA). A true Omega 3 and Omega 6 powerhouse with ALA, SDA and GLA, delivering a healthy 4 to 1 balance of Omega 3 to Omega 6, Ahiflower® oil is the most eco-conscious, sustainable way to get the benefits of EPA found in fish oil from a vegan, plant-based source. ","Vegan gel shell (modified food starch (non-GMO),

Zinc also promotes immune function, taste sensitivity, protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, healthy insulin response and more. Age-related declines in immune function are associated with zinc deficiency. Certain aspects of immune function in the elderly have been found to be supported with zinc supplementation.Chromium plays an important role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels in those within normal range when used as part of a healthy diet.Boron is an essential nutrient for supporting optimal calcium metabolism as well as healthy bones and joints. Boron intake may also support a healthy prostate. It's been shown to help inhibit oxidative stress and support the body’s normal use of reproductive hormones and vitamin D.Vanadyl sulfate is an effective form of the trace mineral vanadium. Research indicates vanadyl sulfate may support insulin response and help maintain already-healthy glucose metabolism. Research also indicates vanadium salts may help maintain already-healthy blood pressure, thyroid health and iron metabolism.Copper is required by the body to convert iron into a form that can be utilized by hemoglobin, and is an essential constituent of many important enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, a major cellular antioxidant.

Research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids helps maintain a healthy heart. But the health benefits of fish oil support more than just the heart and vascular system.Cognitive and joint health supportOmega-3s promote healthy cognitive function, help maintain your mood and encourage healthy blood flow in the brain. Omega-3s also inhibit inflammatory factors to support joint health.That makes taking an omega-rich fish oil supplement an important part of any joint health regimen.Omega-3 vs. omega-6There are two common omega fatty acids in our diets: omega-3s and omega-6s. They’re both essential to health, but balancing the two is even more important, especially since Westerners generally eat foods high in omega-6s and don’t get enough omega-3s. That makes omega-3 supplementation essential. For optimum health, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids should be between 1:1 and 4:1.Made with pure, fresh fish oilMega EPA/DHA is made with fish oil sustainably sourced from anchovy caught wild in the South Pacific. Caught by a Friend of the Sea certified fishery, these fish are processed in a facility located close to the fisheries to preserve freshness.Each two-softgel serving of Mega EPA/DHA contains 720 mg of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and 480 mg of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), making it an affordable and convenient way to get your daily omega-3s.","Highly refined fish oil concentrate (anchovy), fish gelatin (tilapia), glycerin, purified water, natural flavor, mixed tocopherols, rosemary extract.Contains fish (tilapia). ",Supplement FactsServing Size: 2 SoftgelsServings Per Container: 60 Amount Per Serving% Daily ValueCalories20 Total Fat2 g3%†Fish Oil ConcentrateYielding: EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)2000 mg720 mg480 mg********Daily Value not established.†%Daily Value is based on a 2000 calorie diet.,4.8,5839,4627ea47-7cd4-5bd2-8596-cc8ff23a628b,2022-12-15 13:38:21,[],True,"[{'name': 'Daily Value is based on a', 'amount': 2000.0, 'unit': ''}]",False,,,

The length of time for ""Best By"" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter ""Best By"" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct ""Best By"" dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time.

Brain synapses—the connectors through which neurons communicate with each other—have a higher concentration of DHA than almost any other tissue in the body. DHA stimulates the production of neuronal features that underlie learning.Healthy mood support (at all ages)Studies show that DHA is required for the production of essential neuroprotectins to support healthy cell signaling in the brain. In fact, scientists have been focusing research specifically on how sufficient levels of DHA in healthy individuals may support normal mood and behavior in adults and children, as well as normal cognitive function at any age.Eye health and moreDHA is also a major structural fat in the retina of the eye, accounting for up to 60% of the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A wealth of research demonstrates that this important fatty acid plays an important role in our bodies, including helping promote a healthy inflammatory response, supporting blood flow in the brain, promoting cardiovascular health, supporting healthy metabolism and more.Sustainably sourced DHAScientific research has found that the proportions of DHA in body tissue are substantially lower in vegans and vegetarians compared to people who regularly eat animal-sourced foods. So, Life Extension developed a  DHA formulation derived from sustainable algae sources. Made with a highly refined DHA oil derived entirely from algae cells in culture, it meets the most rigid standards of vegan and vegetarian diets—but is also ideal for virtually everyone who wishes to supplement their DHA intake.","Vegetarian softgel (modified

Switch to Imperial units","Dietary SupplementBioavailable Iron With Essential NutrientsBlood BuilderFerrasorb provides 36 mg of elemental iron per capsule, plus the active forms of folate and vitamins B6 and B12, which are essential for blood-building. Vitamin C optimizes iron absorption.Iron deficiency can manifest as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, dizziness, tinnitus, spots before the eyes, drowsiness, irritability, infrequent menses, and loss of libido. Individuals who have a greater need for iron, or who tend to chronically lose iron, or who don't absorb iron well, can benefit from a formula that can increase the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, such as Ferrasorb. Studies indicate that combining iron with essential B vitamins and vitamin C is superior to using these nutrients individually.

The length of time for ""Best By"" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter ""Best By"" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct ""Best By"" dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time.

Switch to Imperial units","Gluten FreeDietary SupplementFoundationalWomen's HealthNSF Certified SportOptimal balance of B vitamins with extra B6 for brain and nerve health and PMS discomfort.B-Complex #6 includes essential B vitamins. Its extra B6 is important for neurotransmitter synthesis, which is essential for stress and mood support. It can also help modulate fluid retention.B-Complex #6 is NSF Certified for Sport®. Most B vitamins, with the exception of vitamin B12, are not stored in the body; consequently, they must be acquired daily from the diet in order to maintain optimal health. Thorne's B-Complex #6 contains an optimal balance of essential B vitamins with extra vitamin B6. B-Complex #6 contains thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin and riboflavin 5'-phosphate (vitamin B2), niacinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine and pyridoxal 5'-phospate (vitamin B6), methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), methyl-folate (5-MTHF), and biotin. Although each B vitamin is chemically distinct, they often work together in various biochemical functions throughout the body – from cellular energy production, to healthy red-blood-cell formation, to healthy neurological function. B-Complex #6 offer both pyridoxine and active pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to support brain function through neurotransmitter synthesis and neurological function through the formation of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. B6 can also help relieve the symptom of fluid retention and support a good mood in individuals with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).Supplementing with active B vitamins is important for everyone, and especially for individuals whose livers may not be able to convert the non-active B vitamin forms to their active forms because of compromised liver function, poorly functioning enzymes, digestive disturbances, or age.Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and its bioactive form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (P5P), are essential for such processes as amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and glycogen (storage sugar) breakdown. Pyridoxine and P5P are also involved in heme synthesis (necessary for hemoglobin), conversion of tryptophan to niacin, and the proper metabolism of fatty acids. Thorne's B-Complex #6 supplies 106 mg of pyridoxine HCl, 25 mg pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and the bioactive forms of other B vitamins in each capsule to provide an optimally bioavailable B complex.Because an athlete needs to know that his or her supplements are trustworthy and compliant, every batch of an NSF Certified for Sport® product is tested for compliance with label claims and to ensure the absence of more than 200 substances banned by many major athletic organizations, including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, and masking agents.","Hypromellose (derived from cellulose) capsule, cellulose, calcium laurate, silicon dioxide.","Supplement FactsServing Size: One Capsule One Capsule Contains:%Daily ValueThiamin (as Thiamin HCl)40 mg3,333%Riboflavin (25 mg as Riboflavin and 5 mg as Riboflavin 5'-Phosphate Sodium)30 mg2,308%Niacin (as Niacinamide)80 mg500%Vitamin B6 (85 mg from 106 mg as Pyridoxine HCl and 15 mg from 25 mg Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate)100 mg5,882%Folate (200 mcg as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate† from L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt)334 mcg DFE84%Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin)100 mcg4,167%Biotin80 mcg267%Pantothenic Acid (as Calcium Pantothenate)45 mg900%Choline (as Choline Citrate)14 mg3%†This product uses Gnosis S.p.A.'s L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt (Quatrefolic®).",4.8,1715,1b889c1d-af2d-57c4-aa60-e185782f40a3,2022-12-15 14:07:20,"[{'name': 'Riboflavin (25 mg as Riboflavin and', 'amount': 5.0, 'unit': 'mg', 'raw_line': ""Supplement FactsServing Size:\xa0One Capsule\xa0One Capsule Contains:%Daily ValueThiamin (as Thiamin HCl)40 mg3,333%Riboflavin (25 mg as Riboflavin and 5 mg as Riboflavin 5'-Phosphate Sodium)30 mg2,308%Niacin (as Niacinamide)80 mg500%Vitamin B6 (85 mg from 106 mg as Pyridoxine HCl and 15 mg from 25 mg Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate)100 mg5,882%Folate (200 mcg as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate† from L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt)334 mcg DFE84%Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin)100 mcg4,167%Biotin80 mcg267%Pantothenic Acid (as Calcium Pantothenate)45 mg900%Choline (as Choline Citrate)14 mg3%†This product uses Gnosis S.p.A.'s L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt (Quatrefolic®).""}]",False,"[{'name': 'Riboflavin (25 mg as Riboflavin and', 'amount': 5.0, 'unit': 'mg', 'raw_line': ""Supplement FactsServing Size:\xa0One Capsule\xa0One Capsule Contains:%Daily ValueThiamin (as Thiamin HCl)40 mg3,333%Riboflavin (25 mg as Riboflavin and 5 mg as Riboflavin 5'-Phosphate Sodium)30 mg2,308%Niacin (as Niacinamide)80 mg500%Vitamin B6 (85 mg from 106 mg as Pyridoxine HCl and 15 mg from 25 mg Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate)100 mg5,882%Folate (200 mcg as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate† from L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt)334 mcg DFE84%Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin)100 mcg4,167%Biotin80 mcg267%Pantothenic Acid (as Calcium Pantothenate)45 mg900%Choline (as Choline Citrate)14 mg3%†This product uses Gnosis S.p.A.'s L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid, Glucosamine Salt (Quatrefolic®).""}]",False,,,

Switch to Imperial units","Dietary SupplementBrain/NervesGluten FreeNeurological health today is constantly being challenged by factors such as increased lifespan, environmental toxicity, and poor diet with resulting nutrient deficiencies. Thorne believes the foundation of neurological health is the health and efficacy of mitochondria – the cellular component that produces the body's energy. So it's crucial that the body's built-in antioxidant system effectively inhibits the free radicals that tend to be produced by the mitochondria. Thorne's Neurochondria formula is comprised of well-researched nutrients that support neurological health. Neurochondria provides antioxidant protection for sensitive neuronal tissue, it enhances neurotransmitter synthesis, optimizes mitochondrial energetics and cell membrane support, and promotes nerve cell function.Neurochondria was one of the first comprehensive neurological support formulations of its kind in the supplement market. Antioxidant protection for sensitive neuronal tissue is provided by R-lipoic acid and glutathione. Enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis is supported by acetyl-L-carnitine. Optimal mitochondrial energetics are supported by coenzyme Q10. Cell membranes are supported by phosphatidylserine, and enhanced nerve cell function is supported by benfotiamine, 5-MTHF, and methylcobalamin.","Hypromellose (derived from cellulose) capsule, microcrystalline cellulose,  leucine, calcium laurate, magnesium citrate, silicon dioxide.Contains ingredient derived from soy (phosphatidylserine).

The length of time for ""Best By"" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter ""Best By"" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
