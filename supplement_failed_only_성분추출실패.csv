The length of time for ""Best By"" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter ""Best By"" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct ""Best By"" dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time.

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width & height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material.

Vegetarians and the elderly are especially susceptible to deficiency of this important nutrient, which may be caused by low dietary intake, inadequate bioavailability or poor absorption of B12. The age-related decrease in hydrochloric acid production can also affect B12 bioavailability.B12 SupplementationTo overcome obstacles to vitamin B12 absorption, the Institute of Medicine recommended in 1998 that vitamin B12-fortified foods (such as fortified ready-to-eat breakfast cereals) and supplements containing vitamin B12 be used by older adults to help meet their B12 requirement.More recent research shows that supplementing with B12, even at moderate doses, can improve both B12 and folate status in older individuals.Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, works synergistically with vitamin B6 and folate to convert homocysteine into the amino acid methionine. This helps to maintain healthy levels of homocysteine, an emerging marker of cardiovascular, neurological and general health.","Xylitol, sorbitol, maltodextrin, stearic acid, vegetable stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, natural vanilla flavor, rice starch, modified food starch.","Supplement FactsServing Size: 1 Vegetarian Lozenge Amount Per Serving% Daily Value Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin)1 mg41,667%",4.7,422,a9aa982b-a959-594b-92be-9f63e39293c9,2022-12-15 13:43:53,[],False,,True,성분 추출 실패,성분 추출 실패,"[{'name': 'Supplement FactsServing Size', 'amount': 1.0, 'unit': ''}, {'name': 'Vitamin B', 'amount': 12.0, 'unit': ''}, {'name': '(as methylcobalamin)', 'amount': 1.0, 'unit': 'mg'}, {'name': '4', 'amount': 1667.0, 'unit': ''}]"

Switch to Imperial units","Natural Digestive Health & WellnessIncreases Telomerase ActivityProtects TelomeresSupports Cellular VitalityNon-GMO Certified by NSFVegetarian Dietary SupplementCellular aging is the process by which a cell becomes old and dies due in large part to the shortening of its telomeres. Telomeres are the protective tips at the ends of chromosomes that protect our DNA. When the cell divides, the tips shorten. Over time, they become too short to sustain cell division and the cell dies. Other influences include age, stress, poor lifestyle choices and exposure to environmental toxins. To support healthy aging, it is essential to maintain telomere length. Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that lengthens telomeres and protects them from shortening.

Switch to Imperial units","Dietary SupplementGI SupportFoundationalNSF - Certified SportGluten FreeL-glutamine is an amino acid that supports a healthy intestinal lining and immune function, and assists in healing after injury or surgery and in muscle cell repair. Thorne's L-Glutamine Powder is NSF Certified for Sport®. Evidence suggests supplemental L-glutamine benefits gastrointestinal health, supports wound healing, maintains immune health, and helps restore plasma glutamine levels depleted after periods of physical stress, such as prolonged exhaustive exercise. L-glutamine is the most prevalent amino acid in the bloodstream. It is found in high concentration in the gastrointestinal tract, which is its greatest user. Various stress factors – such as trauma, infection, malnutrition, chemotherapy, injury, and high-level athletic training – can adversely affect absorption in the small intestine, leading to food allergies. In numerous animal studies, the addition of L-glutamine improved absorption, as well as the gut's immune function.Skeletal muscles contain the greatest intracellular concentration of L-glutamine. But that concentration can be adversely affected by various insults, including injury, infection, chronic stress, malnutrition, and glucocorticoid use. Intense exercise lowers blood levels of glutamine, which can remain low if intense training is repeated without adequate recovery. Research indicates L-glutamine supplementation can offset these conditions.Because an athlete needs to know that his or her supplements are trustworthy and compliant, every batch of an NSF Certified for Sport® product is tested for compliance with label claims and to ensure the absence of more than 200 substances banned by many major athletic organizations, including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, and masking agents.",,Supplement FactsServing Size: One Scoop (5.7 g)Servings Per Container: 90 One Scoop (5.7 g) Contains:%DVL-Glutamine5 g**Daily Value (DV) not established.,4.6,169,05b4655c-0dd4-550e-8da7-9349ee3d9004,2022-12-15 14:11:39,[],False,,True,성분 추출 실패,성분 추출 실패,"[{'name': 'One Scoop (', 'amount': 5.7, 'unit': 'g'}, {'name': ')Servings Per Container', 'amount': 90.0, 'unit': ''}, {'name': 'One Scoop (', 'amount': 5.7, 'unit': 'g'}, {'name': 'DVL-Glutamine', 'amount': 5.0, 'unit': 'g'}]"

Switch to Imperial units"," Dietary Supplement Energy Thyroid Support Gluten FreeSupports the thyroid gland – a benefit for individuals fatigued by low thyroid hormone levels.Iodine & Tyrosine provides nutritional support for the thyroid gland, which helps improve metabolism and supports individuals with fatigue. Tyrosine also promotes healthy adrenal function.Two thyroid hormones – thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) – regulate the body's metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, directing how the body uses these compounds to produce energy. Thyroxine supports cardiac output, heart rate, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate. The thyroid gland cannot produce these two hormones without the presence of the amino acid L-tyrosine and the mineral iodine. Thus, a deficiency of either the amino acid or the mineral or both can contribute to low thyroid hormone levels. Thorne's Iodine & Tyrosine offers essential mineral and amino acid support for the thyroid gland. Studies have found L-tyrosine can be beneficial for treating fatigue, a common symptom of low thyroid or adrenal hormone levels.Tyrosine is also an important cofactor for adrenal neurotransmitter synthesis, because it is converted in the adrenal glands into dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.Individuals should be aware that some foods can cause a relative iodine deficiency by binding to iodine, which can make the bound iodine inaccessible for thyroid hormone production. These foods include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, soy, peanuts, pine nuts, turnips, and rutabaga, although cooking these foods tends to make them less apt to do this.","Hypromellose (derived from cellulose) capsule, silicon dioxide.",Supplement FactsServing Size:  One Capsule One Capsule Contains:%Daily ValueIodine (as Potassium Iodide)225 mcg150%L-Tyrosine500 mg**Daily Value (DV) not established.,4.8,1805,fe48e640-4c30-5101-ad22-de382f486c08,2022-12-15 14:21:23,[],False,,True,성분 추출 실패,성분 추출 실패,"[{'name': 'Daily ValueIodine (as Potassium Iodide)', 'amount': 225.0, 'unit': 'mcg'}, {'name': '1', 'amount': 50.0, 'unit': ''}, {'name': 'L-Tyrosine', 'amount': 500.0, 'unit': 'mg'}]"

Best By

The length of time for ""Best By"" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter ""Best By"" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct ""Best By"" dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry., Date First Available:  December 18 2007, Shipping Weight:
