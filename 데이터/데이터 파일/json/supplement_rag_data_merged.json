Encouraging healthy T-cell development, our formula also helps maintain a healthy immune response and promotes longevity.Take steps today to support longevity and youthful immune function by supplementing with Standardized Cistanche.Standardized Cistanche BenefitsHelps maintain healthy immune functionSupports blood pressure already within normal rangeEncourages healthy glucose metabolismPromotes longevityStandardized Cistanche That Isn't So StandardPrimarily known for supporting longevity, our formula utilizes the plant extracts found in Cistanche to support more than just healthy aging factors. As a means of supporting an already-healthy inflammatory response and blood pressure, the echinacosides in this plant extract encourage healthy nervous system function for optimal immune senescence protection.Standardized Cistanche provides powerful support against immune senescence. Researchers have found evidence that Cistanche extracts help support healthy glucose metabolism, promote a healthy inflammatory response and maintain already-healthy blood pressure and lipid levels.Scientists have discovered that the echinacoside compound found in Cistanche plant extract stimulates the development of naive T cells and leads to a lower amount of memory T cells, thereby supporting a healthy immune response. Cistanche polysaccharides have also demonstrated positive modulatory effects on T cells and may support vaccine responsiveness. Cistanche also increased natural killer (NK) cell activity, resulting in a 15% life span increase in animal research. In addition, Cistanche and echinacoside have been found to scavenge free radicals, maintain healthy nervous system function and promote longevity.A 12-week human study of a dietary supplement containing standardized Cistanche showed that it encouraged impressive immune factor support after supplementation. Subjects had a 11.7% increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity and a 20.2% increase in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells. An increased CD4/CD8 ratio is indicative of healthy, youthful immune function.For those seeking the effects of Cistanche only, Life Extension® has created a standalone standardized Cistanche that contains the same echinacosides as in the Immune Senescence Protection Formula™.",

    "description": "Dietary SupplementEnviroSimplex® Processed Plant ExtractsThe Most Metabolically Active FormSuitable for Vegetarians/VegansPurity & Potency GuaranteedWhat does coenzymated mean?In order for B vitamins to be utilized effectively by the body, they must be converted into their metabolically active coenzyme forms. For example, two coenzyme forms of vitamin B12 are methylcobalamin and dibencozide.A coenzyme is a naturally occurring compound that partners with specific enzymes in order to help promote a number of beneficial metabolic reactions in the body. Without the coenzyme, the enzyme cannot promote the biochemical reaction that is responsible for our survival. This dual cooperation between coenzyme and enzyme is a process called coenzymated.Taking B vitamins already in their coenzymated forms allows the body to use them directly. Thus, the amount that is needed by the body is less in order to achieve the same benefits. Biocoenzymated takes it one step further. Using our proprietary EnviroSimplex® technology, we've created a unique biocoenzymated process using organic, farm fresh plant extracts from whole food sources and the coenzyme form of B vitamins. The synergy between the phytochemicals found in these plant extracts and the coenzyme B vitamin optimizes absorption.The results? Biocoenzymated delivers the most metabolically active nutrients to your cells to utilize most effectively.Feel the difference.Vitamin B12 helps produce red blood cells, maintain good health, and prevent B12 deficiency states such as pernicious anemia. Methylcobalamin and dibencozide are coenzyme forms of vitamin B12 whereas cyanocobalamin must be converted to its metabolically active coenzyme form in a two-step process. Taking methylcobalamin and/or dibencozide allows for greater absorption and bioavailability than non-coenzyme forms. Natural Factors BioCoenzymated Methylcobalamin & Dibencozide formula is offered in a convenient one-per-day chewable form.Isura™: Non-GMO: Documentation ✔Mass Spec: Lab Tested ✔",

Take a look at the way our medical system is organized - from cardiologists to dermatologists, we have a doctor for nearly every body part. But nature has a well-kept secret...there is no separation between any of our systems. They are all intricately connected in a brilliant dance only nature could orchestrate. At Nature's Secret, we develop our products using this whole-body philosophy.We understand, for example, that sluggish digestion can lead to low energy levels and shouldn't always be supported with caffeinated energy tablets. Our approach focuses on the origins of imbalance, not the signs of imbalance. This is Nature's Secret, total body wholeness and wellness.7-Day Ultimate CleanseOur digestive system is faced daily with the difficult task of not only breaking down and absorbing food, but also filtering harmful chemicals and toxins from our environment as well. 7-Day Ultimate Cleanse offers a unique, 2-part program that works with the body's own internal detoxification systems to cleanse and detoxify through the digestive tract.The two products in 7-Day Ultimate Cleanse are Multi-Herb Digestion & Detox Support and Multi-Fiber Colon Cleanse. Both products include a proprietary blend of nutrients and are designed to be taken together for best results.Part 1: Multi-Herb Digestion & Detox Support - This formulation includes herbs that are traditionally used to support digestive function. This proprietary blend works to support optimum health and a feeling of rejuvenation.Part 2: Multi-Fiber Colon Cleanse - This formulation includes a variety of fiber sources and complementary herbs to support colon detoxification and help promote 2-3 bowel movements per day. This proprietary blend supports the body's own natural cleansing functions. It is designed to promote healthy digestion and elimination.",

That’s why people turn to coffee and energy drinks when they need an extra boost. It’s also no secret that these drinks come with a few side effects — they can leave you feeling jittery, stressed and over-stimulated. Not to mention the extra sugar associated with many drinks. Enter L-theanine, caffeine’s natural soul mate. While caffeine is a stimulant, L-theanine is a non-protein amino acid that helps to calm down the stress-response produced by caffeine without limiting the energy boost. In other words, L-theanine brings out the best of caffeine and helps minimize the worst of it. With Energy + Focus you get a smoother, more focussed energy boost.",

Not The Fish.® A New Generation In Superior Plant-Based OmegasAhiflower® oil is the richest and most effective combined Omega-3 (SDA and ALA) and Omega-6 (GLA and LA) fatty acid source from a single non-GMO plant found in nature. While there are many sources of plant based Omega-3 ALA such as flax, chia, sacha inchi and hemp seed oils, Ahiflower® oil is the richest source of SDA (stearidonic acid) which converts more efficiently to the Omega 3 fatty acid EPA that is found in fish oil. A human clinical trial found that Ahiflower® oil has up to a 3-4 times greater conversion rate to Omega 3 EPA compared to flax seed oil. Ahiflower® oil also contains beneficial Omega 6 gamma linolenic acid (GLA). A true Omega 3 and Omega 6 powerhouse with ALA, SDA and GLA, delivering a healthy 4 to 1 balance of Omega 3 to Omega 6, Ahiflower® oil is the most eco-conscious, sustainable way to get the benefits of EPA found in fish oil from a vegan, plant-based source. ",

Zinc also promotes immune function, taste sensitivity, protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, healthy insulin response and more. Age-related declines in immune function are associated with zinc deficiency. Certain aspects of immune function in the elderly have been found to be supported with zinc supplementation.Chromium plays an important role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels in those within normal range when used as part of a healthy diet.Boron is an essential nutrient for supporting optimal calcium metabolism as well as healthy bones and joints. Boron intake may also support a healthy prostate. It's been shown to help inhibit oxidative stress and support the body’s normal use of reproductive hormones and vitamin D.Vanadyl sulfate is an effective form of the trace mineral vanadium. Research indicates vanadyl sulfate may support insulin response and help maintain already-healthy glucose metabolism. Research also indicates vanadium salts may help maintain already-healthy blood pressure, thyroid health and iron metabolism.Copper is required by the body to convert iron into a form that can be utilized by hemoglobin, and is an essential constituent of many important enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, a major cellular antioxidant. It’s also needed for normal immune function and synthesis of certain proteins. People who consume over 50 mg of zinc daily and/or a high level of fructose are advised to supplement their diet with 2 mg copper several times per week.",

Research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids helps maintain a healthy heart. But the health benefits of fish oil support more than just the heart and vascular system.Cognitive and joint health supportOmega-3s promote healthy cognitive function, help maintain your mood and encourage healthy blood flow in the brain. Omega-3s also inhibit inflammatory factors to support joint health.That makes taking an omega-rich fish oil supplement an important part of any joint health regimen.Omega-3 vs. omega-6There are two common omega fatty acids in our diets: omega-3s and omega-6s. They’re both essential to health, but balancing the two is even more important, especially since Westerners generally eat foods high in omega-6s and don’t get enough omega-3s. That makes omega-3 supplementation essential. For optimum health, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids should be between 1:1 and 4:1.Made with pure, fresh fish oilMega EPA/DHA is made with fish oil sustainably sourced from anchovy caught wild in the South Pacific. Caught by a Friend of the Sea certified fishery, these fish are processed in a facility located close to the fisheries to preserve freshness.Each two-softgel serving of Mega EPA/DHA contains 720 mg of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and 480 mg of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), making it an affordable and convenient way to get your daily omega-3s.",

California Gold Nutrition Antarctic Krill Oil contains premium krill oil in a convenient daily supplement to help support a healthy heart, brain, eyes, and liver.*Benefits of Krill OilKrill oil has gained attention not only for the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids it contains, but also for its bioavailability and the presence of an antioxidant known as astaxanthin. Research suggests that the bioavailability of krill oil may be high because much of the EPA and DHA are bound to phospholipids which aid in the efficient transfer of essential nutrients to the body’s cells.* The omega-3 phospholipids and astaxanthin in krill oil may help to support healthy function of the heart, brain, eyes, and liver.*California Gold Nutrition Antarctic Krill Oil features RIMFROST Krill Oil with naturally occurring (not fortified) astaxanthin that is sourced responsibly from the pristine waters of the Southern Ocean.  The krill oil is contained within fish gelatin softgels that use a natural strawberry and lemon flavored coating to help mask natural krill oil aroma.

    "description": "Gluten FreeNon GMO LE CertifiedAlgae-Sourced Omega-3 for Brain, Eye and Heart HealthDietary SupplementThe omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accounts for 40% of the polyunsaturated fats in the brain. Brain synapses—the connectors through which neurons communicate with each other—have a higher concentration of DHA than almost any other tissue in the body. DHA stimulates the production of neuronal features that underlie learning.Healthy mood support (at all ages)Studies show that DHA is required for the production of essential neuroprotectins to support healthy cell signaling in the brain. In fact, scientists have been focusing research specifically on how sufficient levels of DHA in healthy individuals may support normal mood and behavior in adults and children, as well as normal cognitive function at any age.Eye health and moreDHA is also a major structural fat in the retina of the eye, accounting for up to 60% of the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A wealth of research demonstrates that this important fatty acid plays an important role in our bodies, including helping promote a healthy inflammatory response, supporting blood flow in the brain, promoting cardiovascular health, supporting healthy metabolism and more.Sustainably sourced DHAScientific research has found that the proportions of DHA in body tissue are substantially lower in vegans and vegetarians compared to people who regularly eat animal-sourced foods. So, Life Extension developed a  DHA formulation derived from sustainable algae sources. Made with a highly refined DHA oil derived entirely from algae cells in culture, it meets the most rigid standards of vegan and vegetarian diets—but is also ideal for virtually everyone who wishes to supplement their DHA intake.",

Vitamin C optimizes iron absorption.Iron deficiency can manifest as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, dizziness, tinnitus, spots before the eyes, drowsiness, irritability, infrequent menses, and loss of libido. Individuals who have a greater need for iron, or who tend to chronically lose iron, or who don't absorb iron well, can benefit from a formula that can increase the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, such as Ferrasorb. Studies indicate that combining iron with essential B vitamins and vitamin C is superior to using these nutrients individually. Ferrasorb combines the active forms of vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate), vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), and folate (L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) with well-absorbed iron bisglycinate – for an optimal blood-building supplement. Vitamin C is added to enhance iron's absorption. Individuals who are susceptible to being deficient in iron include teenage girls, pregnant women, women of childbearing age (particularly if they have heavy menses), individuals with malabsorption syndromes (Crohn's disease or Celiac disease), individuals on chemotherapy, elderly patients with low stomach acid secretion, and individuals with poor kidney function.",

    "description": "Gluten FreeDietary SupplementFoundationalWomen's HealthNSF Certified SportOptimal balance of B vitamins with extra B6 for brain and nerve health and PMS discomfort.B-Complex #6 includes essential B vitamins. Its extra B6 is important for neurotransmitter synthesis, which is essential for stress and mood support. It can also help modulate fluid retention.B-Complex #6 is NSF Certified for Sport®. Most B vitamins, with the exception of vitamin B12, are not stored in the body; consequently, they must be acquired daily from the diet in order to maintain optimal health. Thorne's B-Complex #6 contains an optimal balance of essential B vitamins with extra vitamin B6. B-Complex #6 contains thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin and riboflavin 5'-phosphate (vitamin B2), niacinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine and pyridoxal 5'-phospate (vitamin B6), methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), methyl-folate (5-MTHF), and biotin. Although each B vitamin is chemically distinct, they often work together in various biochemical functions throughout the body – from cellular energy production, to healthy red-blood-cell formation, to healthy neurological function. B-Complex #6 offer both pyridoxine and active pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to support brain function through neurotransmitter synthesis and neurological function through the formation of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. B6 can also help relieve the symptom of fluid retention and support a good mood in individuals with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).Supplementing with active B vitamins is important for everyone, and especially for individuals whose livers may not be able to convert the non-active B vitamin forms to their active forms because of compromised liver function, poorly functioning enzymes, digestive disturbances, or age.Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and its bioactive form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (P5P), are essential for such processes as amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and glycogen (storage sugar) breakdown. Pyridoxine and P5P are also involved in heme synthesis (necessary for hemoglobin), conversion of tryptophan to niacin, and the proper metabolism of fatty acids. Thorne's B-Complex #6 supplies 106 mg of pyridoxine HCl, 25 mg pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and the bioactive forms of other B vitamins in each capsule to provide an optimally bioavailable B complex.Because an athlete needs to know that his or her supplements are trustworthy and compliant, every batch of an NSF Certified for Sport® product is tested for compliance with label claims and to ensure the absence of more than 200 substances banned by many major athletic organizations, including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, and masking agents.",

These pancreatic enzymes are essential to the breakdown and absorption of food and its nutrients, helping to promote the normal digestion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Taking pancreatic enzymes supplements shortly after a meal may help relieve occasional gas and bloating.

Thorne believes the foundation of neurological health is the health and efficacy of mitochondria – the cellular component that produces the body's energy. So it's crucial that the body's built-in antioxidant system effectively inhibits the free radicals that tend to be produced by the mitochondria. Thorne's Neurochondria formula is comprised of well-researched nutrients that support neurological health. Neurochondria provides antioxidant protection for sensitive neuronal tissue, it enhances neurotransmitter synthesis, optimizes mitochondrial energetics and cell membrane support, and promotes nerve cell function.Neurochondria was one of the first comprehensive neurological support formulations of its kind in the supplement market. Antioxidant protection for sensitive neuronal tissue is provided by R-lipoic acid and glutathione. Enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis is supported by acetyl-L-carnitine. Optimal mitochondrial energetics are supported by coenzyme Q10. Cell membranes are supported by phosphatidylserine, and enhanced nerve cell function is supported by benfotiamine, 5-MTHF, and methylcobalamin.",

L-Citrulline helps to increase nitric oxide levels in blood. Higher nitric oxide levels may help relax and dilate blood vessels, thus increasing blood circulation to various organs, including the heart, skin and sexual organs. L-Citrulline supports cardiovascular health. It may also help the body rid itself of ammonia, a by-product of exercise. This clearing may enable the body to recover faster after a workout.",

Vegetarians and the elderly are especially susceptible to deficiency of this important nutrient, which may be caused by low dietary intake, inadequate bioavailability or poor absorption of B12. The age-related decrease in hydrochloric acid production can also affect B12 bioavailability.B12 SupplementationTo overcome obstacles to vitamin B12 absorption, the Institute of Medicine recommended in 1998 that vitamin B12-fortified foods (such as fortified ready-to-eat breakfast cereals) and supplements containing vitamin B12 be used by older adults to help meet their B12 requirement.More recent research shows that supplementing with B12, even at moderate doses, can improve both B12 and folate status in older individuals.Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, works synergistically with vitamin B6 and folate to convert homocysteine into the amino acid methionine.

Telomeres are the protective tips at the ends of chromosomes that protect our DNA. When the cell divides, the tips shorten. Over time, they become too short to sustain cell division and the cell dies. Other influences include age, stress, poor lifestyle choices and exposure to environmental toxins. To support healthy aging, it is essential to maintain telomere length. Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that lengthens telomeres and protects them from shortening. Telomere Plus™ has been shown to increase telomerase activity. ",

    "description": "Dietary SupplementGI SupportFoundationalNSF - Certified SportGluten FreeL-glutamine is an amino acid that supports a healthy intestinal lining and immune function, and assists in healing after injury or surgery and in muscle cell repair. Thorne's L-Glutamine Powder is NSF Certified for Sport®. Evidence suggests supplemental L-glutamine benefits gastrointestinal health, supports wound healing, maintains immune health, and helps restore plasma glutamine levels depleted after periods of physical stress, such as prolonged exhaustive exercise. L-glutamine is the most prevalent amino acid in the bloodstream. It is found in high concentration in the gastrointestinal tract, which is its greatest user. Various stress factors – such as trauma, infection, malnutrition, chemotherapy, injury, and high-level athletic training – can adversely affect absorption in the small intestine, leading to food allergies. In numerous animal studies, the addition of L-glutamine improved absorption, as well as the gut's immune function.Skeletal muscles contain the greatest intracellular concentration of L-glutamine. But that concentration can be adversely affected by various insults, including injury, infection, chronic stress, malnutrition, and glucocorticoid use. Intense exercise lowers blood levels of glutamine, which can remain low if intense training is repeated without adequate recovery. Research indicates L-glutamine supplementation can offset these conditions.Because an athlete needs to know that his or her supplements are trustworthy and compliant, every batch of an NSF Certified for Sport® product is tested for compliance with label claims and to ensure the absence of more than 200 substances banned by many major athletic organizations, including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, and masking agents.",

    "description": " Dietary Supplement Energy Thyroid Support Gluten FreeSupports the thyroid gland – a benefit for individuals fatigued by low thyroid hormone levels.Iodine & Tyrosine provides nutritional support for the thyroid gland, which helps improve metabolism and supports individuals with fatigue. Tyrosine also promotes healthy adrenal function.Two thyroid hormones – thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) – regulate the body's metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, directing how the body uses these compounds to produce energy. Thyroxine supports cardiac output, heart rate, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate. The thyroid gland cannot produce these two hormones without the presence of the amino acid L-tyrosine and the mineral iodine. Thus, a deficiency of either the amino acid or the mineral or both can contribute to low thyroid hormone levels. Thorne's Iodine & Tyrosine offers essential mineral and amino acid support for the thyroid gland. Studies have found L-tyrosine can be beneficial for treating fatigue, a common symptom of low thyroid or adrenal hormone levels.Tyrosine is also an important cofactor for adrenal neurotransmitter synthesis, because it is converted in the adrenal glands into dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.Individuals should be aware that some foods can cause a relative iodine deficiency by binding to iodine, which can make the bound iodine inaccessible for thyroid hormone production. These foods include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, soy, peanuts, pine nuts, turnips, and rutabaga, although cooking these foods tends to make them less apt to do this.",
