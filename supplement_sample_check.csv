We are passionate about bringing you the finest selection of products which can perfectly complement a healthy diet and active lifestyle.L citrulline is an amino acid and precursor of L-Arginine; it is converted into L-Arginine once inside the body. L-Citrulline helps to increase nitric oxide levels in blood. Higher nitric oxide levels may help relax and dilate blood vessels, thus increasing blood circulation to various organs, including the heart, skin and sexual organs. L-Citrulline supports cardiovascular health. It may also help the body rid itself of ammonia, a by-product of exercise. This clearing may enable the body to recover faster after a workout."
"Thorne Research, Iodine & Tyrosine, 60 Capsules",Thorne Research,L-Tyrosine,Iodine," Dietary Supplement Energy Thyroid Support Gluten FreeSupports the thyroid gland – a benefit for individuals fatigued by low thyroid hormone levels.Iodine & Tyrosine provides nutritional support for the thyroid gland, which helps improve metabolism and supports individuals with fatigue. Tyrosine also promotes healthy adrenal function.Two thyroid hormones – thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) – regulate the body's metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, directing how the body uses these compounds to produce energy. Thyroxine supports cardiac output, heart rate, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate. The thyroid gland cannot produce these two hormones without the presence of the amino acid L-tyrosine and the mineral iodine. Thus, a deficiency of either the amino acid or the mineral or both can contribute to low thyroid hormone levels. Thorne's Iodine & Tyrosine offers essential mineral and amino acid support for the thyroid gland. Studies have found L-tyrosine can be beneficial for treating fatigue, a common symptom of low thyroid or adrenal hormone levels.Tyrosine is also an important cofactor for adrenal neurotransmitter synthesis, because it is converted in the adrenal glands into dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.Individuals should be aware that some foods can cause a relative iodine deficiency by binding to iodine, which can make the bound iodine inaccessible for thyroid hormone production. These foods include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, soy, peanuts, pine nuts, turnips, and rutabaga, although cooking these foods tends to make them less apt to do this."

It’s also needed for normal immune function and synthesis of certain proteins. People who consume over 50 mg of zinc daily and/or a high level of fructose are advised to supplement their diet with 2 mg copper several times per week."

As a means of supporting an already-healthy inflammatory response and blood pressure, the echinacosides in this plant extract encourage healthy nervous system function for optimal immune senescence protection.Standardized Cistanche provides powerful support against immune senescence. Researchers have found evidence that Cistanche extracts help support healthy glucose metabolism, promote a healthy inflammatory response and maintain already-healthy blood pressure and lipid levels.Scientists have discovered that the echinacoside compound found in Cistanche plant extract stimulates the development of naive T cells and leads to a lower amount of memory T cells, thereby supporting a healthy immune response. Cistanche polysaccharides have also demonstrated positive modulatory effects on T cells and may support vaccine responsiveness. Cistanche also increased natural killer (NK) cell activity, resulting in a 15% life span increase in animal research. In addition, Cistanche and echinacoside have been found to scavenge free radicals, maintain healthy nervous system function and promote longevity.A 12-week human study of a dietary supplement containing standardized Cistanche showed that it encouraged impressive immune factor support after supplementation. Subjects had a 11.7% increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity and a 20.2% increase in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells. An increased CD4/CD8 ratio is indicative of healthy, youthful immune function.For those seeking the effects of Cistanche only, Life Extension® has created a standalone standardized Cistanche that contains the same echinacosides as in the Immune Senescence Protection Formula™."

"Zhou Nutrition, Energy + Focus, 60 Veggie Capsules",Zhou Nutrition,Cognitive & Memory Formulas,Energy Formulas,"Caffeine + L-TheanineDietary SupplementLab VerifiedVeganGreatness by Nature™Focused Energy Support for Mind & BodyGluten FreeMade With Non-GMO IngredientsSupports Smooth & Jitter Free EnergyIt’s no secret that caffeine can provide some much needed energy throughout the day. That’s why people turn to coffee and energy drinks when they need an extra boost. It’s also no secret that these drinks come with a few side effects — they can leave you feeling jittery, stressed and over-stimulated. Not to mention the extra sugar associated with many drinks. Enter L-theanine, caffeine’s natural soul mate. While caffeine is a stimulant, L-theanine is a non-protein amino acid that helps to calm down the stress-response produced by caffeine without limiting the energy boost. In other words, L-theanine brings out the best of caffeine and helps minimize the worst of it. With Energy + Focus you get a smoother, more focussed energy boost."
